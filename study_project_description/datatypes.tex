The supported data types are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textcolor{teal}{ı’Ŧ} (integer)
    \item \textcolor{teal}{ÐØ↑‘Ł€} (double)
    \item \textcolor{teal}{ẞŦ®ı’Ŋ} (string) Usage: \textcolor{teal}{⅜insert\_string\_here⅜}
    \item \textcolor{teal}{©ĦÆ®} (character) Usage: Coming soon, see lexer file
    \item \textcolor{teal}{‚ØıÐ} (void)
\end{itemize}
\noindent
The language has a strong type system, which means that every variable has a type and
the type of a variable can not be changed. The type of a variable is determined on declaration.
Trying to assign a value of a different type to a variable will result in a type mismatch error.
