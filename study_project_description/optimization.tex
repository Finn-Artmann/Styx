Constant folding is implemented for arithmetic operations.
The optimization takes place while the AST is being traversed and is 
implemented in the \textit{operation} function in the \textit{src/ast.c} source file.
When the AST is traversed, and an operation is encountered for the
first time, the operation is evaluated, and the result is stored in the
\textit{value} field of the node. This optimization is only possible if 
all child nodes have a constant value. For this reason each ast node has a
\textit{is\_const} field. A node is marked as constant if all child nodes are
constant. When the original operation node is encountered again, the node is 
marked as constant and \textit{value} field can be used instead of traversing the
child nodes again.
