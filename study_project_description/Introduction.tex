The programming language "SŦYX" is an esoteric, interpreted programming language,
which mainly uses UTF-8 special characters. It is therefore inherently hard to read.
The syntax is oriented on the programming
language C.  The Interpreter is for SŦYX written in C using "flex"
and "bison" as a lexer and parser generator.
The interpreter builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) while parsing the source code and
executes the AST afterwards. The following chapters will describe the syntax of SŦYX
and the implementation of the interpreter.
