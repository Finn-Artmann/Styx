After the AST is executed and fully traversed the parser will generate a
Graphviz file, which can be used to visualize the AST. To display node names 
in a human-readable form, token IDs are converted to their corresponding
token names using the internal token table provided by bison.
There also is a function to print the AST to console.\newline
By setting the pre-compiler directive \textit{\#define DEBUG\_AST} in the header file
each node of the AST will be printed to the console while traversing it.
